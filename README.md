Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Internet and Web Programming! Here, you'll find a concise overview of the key concepts and technologies I've learned in the class. Whether you're revising or seeking a quick refresher, this guide will help you confidently navigate the world of web development.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

## Front-end Development
Front-end development focuses on creating the user interface and user experience of a website. Here are the core technologies learned:

### HTML
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) provides the structure and content of web pages. HTML tags, elements, attributes, and semantic markup to create well-structured documents.

### CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) enables us to control the presentation and layout of web pages. We studied element properties, values, and cascading rules to style HTML elements and achieve desired visual effects.

### JavaScript
JavaScript is a powerful programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. We covered variables, data types, functions, control flow, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
